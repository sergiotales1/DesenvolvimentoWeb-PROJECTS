      var name = prompt('What is your name? ')

      var age = prompt('What is your age? ')
      var age2 = 50

      document.write('<h1>Hello, '+ name +', its glad to have you here at the peak of yours '+ age +'s! </h1>')

      //remember that prompt is receiving the value into string type

      console.log(age)
      console.log(age2)

      // reading the console log we see the variable age with its value in black color as a string type and the age2 as a blue color as number type.
